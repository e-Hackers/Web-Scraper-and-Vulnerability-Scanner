## Description
The Web Scraper and Vulnerability Scanner is a Python tool designed to extract emails from webpages, search for sensitive data such as usernames and passwords, and check if URLs are allowed by robots.txt rules. It can be used for various purposes including reconnaissance, security testing, and data collection.

## Features
- **Email Extraction:** Automatically extracts emails from visited webpages.
- **Sensitive Data Search:** Scans webpages for sensitive data such as usernames and passwords.
- **Robots.txt Check:** Verifies if URLs are allowed to be crawled based on robots.txt rules.
- **Support for Multiple File Types:** Searches for sensitive data in JavaScript, PHP, HTML, and other file types.
- **User-Agent Spoofing:** Utilizes a custom User-Agent header to mimic a web browser and avoid detection.
- **URL Queue Management:** Uses a deque to efficiently manage a queue of URLs for scanning.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles errors and exceptions to ensure smooth execution.

## Usage
1. **Installation:** Clone the project repository and ensure that the required Python packages (`beautifulsoup4`, `requests`) are installed.
2. **Execution:** Run the `web_scraper.py` script using Python 3.x. Enter the target URL when prompted.
3. **Output:** The tool will display a list of extracted emails and sensitive data along with their corresponding URL paths.
